            <h3><u>Goals</u></h3>
                <p>I had a bunch of goals set for my first year in college, even my first semester at that. It's kind of sad that I couldn't really get to do them.</p>   
            <ol>

                <p>1. I wanted to be able to go on campus.</p>
                <p>2. I wanted to be able to experience actual in person classes in order to get use to things.</p>
                <p>3. I wanted to see people again.</p>
                <p>4. I wanted to have fun in school.</p>
            </ol>

                <h3><u>Accomplishments</u></h3>
                <p>I've at least done some things within this semester even with this online learning.</p>

                <p>1. I've made lots of new friends through this period!</p>
                <p>2. I've been able to join a club!</p>
                <p>3. I've gotten a bit better at setting a volleyball!</p>
                <p>4. I've also been able to get a lot closer to my family again during times, which made me very happy and boosted my mental health from all the stress!</p>
                <p>5. I've gotten to learn so much about the history of coding and HTML as well as some CSS.</p>
